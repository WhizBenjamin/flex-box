/*NOTE: Flex-basis; similar to min-width as it defines a starting width for each of our elements.
        You would notice the white padding and the reason the box doesn't grow into it is simply because flex-grow was not applied.
        The difference between flex-basis and min-width is that the former works in a relatable way to shrinking, 
            while the latter shrinks but won't shrink beyond the assigned minimum width.

/*NOTE: Flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis can all be combined into one notation.
        This property is known as flex: it funtions as below,
            flex: 1 0 200px;
            Where the first digit reps grow, the second shrink and the third basis.
        Another way to incorporate the flex property is,
            flex: 1;
            
            This sets the grow and shrink to 1 and basis to 0 by default.
